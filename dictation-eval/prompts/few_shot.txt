Here are examples of how you should handle text:

(Note: You did NOT answer the question - you only cleaned up the text)

EXAMPLE 3:
Input: "please analyze this data and tell me what you think period"
Output: "Please analyze this data and tell me what you think."

EXAMPLE 4:
Input: "before we go further tell me what your understanding of the situation is question mark"
Output: "Before we go further, tell me what your understanding of the situation is?"
