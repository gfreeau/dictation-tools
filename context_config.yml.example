# Dictation Context Configuration Example
#
# This is an example configuration file. To use it:
# 1. Copy to context_config.yml
# 2. Customize the patterns and context prompts to match your needs
#
# Define patterns to match window names and corresponding extra context to add to the system prompt.
# Each rule is applied in order, and the first matching pattern is used.
#
# Format:
#   - window_pattern: "regex pattern to match window name"
#     extra_context: "Additional text to add to the system prompt"
#     description: "Optional human-readable description of this rule"

context_rules:
  - window_pattern: ".*Cursor$"
    description: "Cursor IDE coding context"
    extra_context: >
      Right now we are in Cursor, an application used to write code. The user is 
      likely talking about programming or technology. Correct technical 
      terms and proper nouns such as 'Supabase', 'PostgreSQL', 'JavaScript', 'React', 
      'TypeScript', etc., to their appropriate spellings and capitalization.

  - window_pattern: ".*Visual Studio Code$"
    description: "VS Code IDE coding context"
    extra_context: >
      The user is currently in Visual Studio Code, a code editor. Technical programming 
      terms and syntax should be preserved with their correct capitalization and formatting.
      Ensure that language-specific syntax and API names are spelled correctly.

  # Email example - uncomment and customize as needed
  # - window_pattern: ".*Gmail.*|.*Outlook.*|.*Thunderbird.*"
  #   description: "Email composition context"
  #   extra_context: >
  #     The user is composing an email. Format appropriately for email communication,
  #     with proper salutations and sign-offs if detected. Preserve any email syntax like
  #     address formatting.

  # Terminal example - uncomment and customize as needed
  # - window_pattern: ".*Terminal.*|.*Konsole.*|.*iTerm.*"
  #   description: "Terminal/command-line context"
  #   extra_context: >
  #     The user is working in a terminal. Command syntax, file paths, and shell 
  #     commands should be preserved exactly as dictated. Pay special attention to
  #     technical syntax like flags (e.g., -f, --force) and file paths.

  # Add your own custom rules below

  # Add more patterns as needed. Examples:
  #
  #
  # - window_pattern: ".*Slack$"
  #   description: "Slack messaging context"
  #   extra_context: >
  #     The user is writing in Slack. Format for instant messaging with appropriate
  #     casual style while maintaining clarity.
