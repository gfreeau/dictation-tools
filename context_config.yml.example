# Dictation Context Configuration Example
#
# This is an example configuration file. To use it:
# 1. Copy to context_config.yml
# 2. Customize the patterns and context prompts to match your needs
#
# Define patterns to match window names and corresponding extra context to add to the system prompt.
# Each rule is applied in order, and the first matching pattern is used.
#
# Format:
#   - window_pattern: "regex pattern to match window name"
#     extra_context: "Additional text to add to the system prompt"
#     description: "Optional human-readable description of this rule"

context_rules:
  # Specific IDE rules (match first, higher priority)
  - window_pattern: ".*Cursor.*"
    description: "Cursor IDE coding context"
    extra_context: >
      Right now we are in Cursor, an application used to write code.
      The user is likely discussing programming, web development, databases, and technology.
      Correct technical terms and proper nouns to their appropriate spellings and capitalisation.

  - window_pattern: ".*(Visual Studio Code|VSCodium).*"
    description: "VS Code/VSCodium IDE coding context"
    extra_context: >
      Right now we are in a code editor.
      The user is likely discussing programming, web development, databases, and technology.
      Correct technical terms and proper nouns to their appropriate spellings and capitalisation.

  # Email example - uncomment and customize as needed
  # - window_pattern: ".*Gmail.*|.*Outlook.*|.*Thunderbird.*"
  #   description: "Email composition context"
  #   extra_context: >
  #     The user is composing an email. Format appropriately for email communication,
  #     with proper salutations and sign-offs if detected. Preserve any email syntax like
  #     address formatting.

  # Terminal example - uncomment and customize as needed
  # - window_pattern: ".*Terminal.*|.*Konsole.*|.*iTerm.*"
  #   description: "Terminal/command-line context"
  #   extra_context: >
  #     The user is working in a terminal. Command syntax, file paths, and shell 
  #     commands should be preserved exactly as dictated. Pay special attention to
  #     technical syntax like flags (e.g., -f, --force) and file paths.

  # Generic catch-all for all other windows (matches last)
  # This provides technical context everywhere, letting the AI infer correct technical terms
  # without explicit examples. Comment out if you only want context in specific apps.
  - window_pattern: ".*"
    description: "Generic technical context"
    extra_context: >
      The user commonly speaks about programming, web development, databases, and technology.
      Correct technical terms and proper nouns to their appropriate spellings and capitalisation.

  # Add more specific patterns above the catch-all. Examples:
  #
  # - window_pattern: ".*Slack$"
  #   description: "Slack messaging context"
  #   extra_context: >
  #     The user is writing in Slack. Format for instant messaging with appropriate
  #     casual style while maintaining clarity.
